# Password-Generator


Here is what I can suggest for next steps:
• use a random # to get characters from charArray
• append the random character from charArray to the end of the password variable
• Add console.log statements to view the info your code is producing
• you might also want to meet with your mentor to walk you through the logic, (edited)
